## Install

Get yourself some bundling power with [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) if it's not already installed:

```
gem install bundler
```

Clone or download this mofo into a local folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/aderaaij/ardicus.git lets_boogie
```

CD into the folder and give the magic ```bundle install``` command  to install all required gems incuding Middleman

Use ```bundle exec middleman``` for development and ```bundle exec middleman build``` to render your static file output to the ```/build/``` directory.
